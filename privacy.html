<h3>Overall privacy</h3>
<p style="font-size:23px;"> 
   This site uses an external api to grab an IP address from your browser 
   and use it to help assign an identifier. It is encoded in base64 then a 
   substring of the base64 is taken so no one can truly know your IP address, 
   but your ip will always have a matching string. Allowing me to index users posts etc. 
   The whole point of this site is to be seemingly anonymous, which is why I do not allow 
   usernames or other fourms of identifing other users. The exact contents of what are submitted 
   can be seen within a google spreadsheet <a style="font-size:28px;" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arXjPy5iUERug2miLIPZKs0equJKxcT-QMqika16gm0/edit#gid=0" >HERE</a> 
   If for some reason you would like to clear your identifer for a new one or so it cannot be indexed 
   please press the button below. Keep in mind the moment you open the main page index.html 
   it will assign a new identifer. If you have an identifier it will show right below this text. 
   The first {} is the base64 encoded portion of your ip which is also reversed. The second {} 
   is a set of five random identifiers for users who exist on a lan.

<p style="font-size:23px;"> 
   If you truly just want me out of your cookies this site also stores a copy of 
   every entry and it's following meta data within localStorage if the text below 
   reads as a TRUE boolean this data exists on your browser again there will be a button to remove
   that as well.
